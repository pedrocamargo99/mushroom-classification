# Mushroom Classification using multiple Machine Learning Algoritms
Solving a Classification problem in Python as a part of my Data Analysis Course assessment. Consists of implementing multiple ML Algoritms using the same Database, evaluating the results of each and inferring the best one.

ðŸ“• **Database Description**

Name: 
Mushroom Classification

Content:
Dataset includes descriptions of samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.
